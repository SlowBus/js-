#什么是作用域--变量

  变量是存储在哪儿的，程序是如何找到它的，这一系列的规则就叫做作用域。那么，作用域--这些关于变量存取的规则，又是何时设定的呢？
  javascript，虽然常被称为‘解释型’，‘动态语言’，但它其实是编译型语言。
  
  Engine: responsible for start-to-finish compilation and execution of our JavaScript program.

Compiler: one of Engine's friends; handles all the dirty work of parsing and code-generation (see previous section).

Scope: another friend of Engine; collects and maintains a look-up list of all the declared identifiers (variables), and enforces a strict set of rules as to how these are accessible to currently executing code.

var a = 2
First, Compiler declares a variable (if not previously declared in the current scope), and second, when executing, Engine looks up the variable in Scope and assigns to it, if found.


LHS and RHS meaning "left/right-hand side of an assignment" doesn't necessarily literally mean "left/right side of the = assignment operator". There are several other ways that assignments happen, and so it's better to conceptually think about it as: "who's the target of the assignment (LHS)" and "who's the source of the assignment (RHS)".

function foo(a) {
	console.log( a ); // 2
}

foo( 2 );

>Engine: Hey Scope, I have an RHS reference for foo. Ever heard of it?
>Scope: Why yes, I have. Compiler declared it just a second ago. He's a function. Here you go.
>Engine: Great, thanks! OK, I'm executing foo.
>Engine: Hey, Scope, I've got an LHS reference for a, ever heard of it?
>Scope: Why yes, I have. Compiler declared it as a formal parameter to foo just recently. Here you go.
>Engine: Helpful as always, Scope. Thanks again. Now, time to assign 2 to a.
>Engine: Hey, Scope, sorry to bother you again. I need an RHS look-up for console. Ever heard of it?
>Scope: No problem, Engine, this is what I do all day. Yes, I've got console. He's built-in. Here ya go.
>Engine: Perfect. Looking up log(..). OK, great, it's a function.
>Engine: Yo, Scope. Can you help me out with an RHS reference to a. I think I remember it, but just want to double-check.
>Scope: You're right, Engine. Same guy, hasn't changed. Here ya go.
>Engine: Cool. Passing the value of a, which is 2, into log(..).
>...


function foo(a) {
	console.log( a + b );
	b = a;
}

foo( 2 );
When the RHS look-up occurs for b the first time, it will not be found. This is said to be an "undeclared" variable, because it is not found in the scope.

If an RHS look-up fails to ever find a variable, anywhere in the nested Scopes, this results in a ReferenceError being thrown by the Engine. It's important to note that the error is of the type ReferenceError.

By contrast, if the Engine is performing an LHS look-up and arrives at the top floor (global Scope) without finding it, and if the program is not running in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode], then the global Scope will create a new variable of that name in the global scope, and hand it back to Engine.


Scope is the set of rules that determines where and how a variable (identifier) can be looked-up. This look-up may be for the purposes of assigning to the variable, which is an LHS (left-hand-side) reference, or it may be for the purposes of retrieving its value, which is an RHS (right-hand-side) reference.

LHS references result from assignment operations. Scope-related assignments can occur either with the = operator or by passing arguments to (assign to) function parameters.

The JavaScript Engine first compiles code before it executes, and in so doing, it splits up statements like var a = 2; into two separate steps:

First, var a to declare it in that Scope. This is performed at the beginning, before code execution.

Later, a = 2 to look up the variable (LHS reference) and assign to it if found.

Both LHS and RHS reference look-ups start at the currently executing Scope, and if need be (that is, they don't find what they're looking for there), they work their way up the nested Scope, one scope (floor) at a time, looking for the identifier, until they get to the global (top floor) and stop, and either find it, or don't.

Unfulfilled RHS references result in ReferenceErrors being thrown. Unfulfilled LHS references result in an automatic, implicitly-created global of that name (if not in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]), or a ReferenceError (if in "Strict Mode" [^note-strictmode]).
